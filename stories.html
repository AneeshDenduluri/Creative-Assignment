            Mark Lewis was an officer who helped other personnel evacuate the building and took part in the search and rescue initiatives in order to try and identify who survived the attack. He described the painstaking process of having to gather a list of those who probably perished in the attack with heartbreaking emotions. Kathy Dillaber was an analyst working in the Pentagon with her sister, Patricia Mickley. They last saw each other a couple hours before the attack on the Pentagon, discussing the attacks on the Twin Towers. She had to wait 8 days after the attack for her sisterâ€™s body to be identified. The video ends with both Mark and Kathy describing their sense of comradery shared after the attacks, and how they carry on the legacy of their lost ones every day.

            Harry Ong Jr. is the brother of Betty Ong, a flight attendant on board Flight 11. He recounts waking up to the news of the plance crashes and leaving a voicemail to her number to ask if she was okay. He then called American Airlines directly, who told him that she was on board the flight that crashed into the North Tower. His family still mourns her to this day.

            Frank Razzano was a guest at the Mariot Hotel located between the Twin Towers. In the above link, Frank recounts his harrowing experience waking up to the loud explosion. The entire building, both ceilings and steel beams, collapse around him. As he wonders whether or not he would make it out of the building alive, he heard a fireman call for him to follow. There was no way out of the building except to grab a fallen beam and slide down. As he slid, the North Tower collapsed, and by some miracle, Frank survived.
