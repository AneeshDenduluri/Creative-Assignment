            <h3>Short-Term Effects</h3>
          </div>
          <p class="service-text">
          Although the day is imprinted forever in America's history, some of the effects from the tragedy were short-lived. Some these effects include increased ratings for news outlets, an increased approval rate of the government, and an overall increase in national pride. According to the Pew Research Center, 86% of adults surveyed approve of Bush's presidency following the events of 9/11, but the approval rating had dropped down to about 24% by 2008 (the end of his presidency). Around 80% of adults surveyed claimed that they displayed an American flag and 60% placed their trust in their federal government, both statistics being halved by 2005. Additionally, this period boasted an all-time high news organization ratings, as the majority of Americans would be glued to the news following the incident.

          </div>
          <p class="service-text">
          The tragedy of the day never truly went away for the American People. According to the Pew Research Center, after 15 years since the September 11 attacks, 76% of adults surveyed named 9/11 as one the most historical events during their lifetime. A memorial built in place of where the two towers once stood, forever commemorating those who were lost in the attacks.

            <h3>The War on Terrorism</h3>
          </div>
          <p class="service-text">
            After the attacks, the public also supported the war in Afghanistan to fight terrorism for many years to come. So much so that about 49% of the public felt that the Bush Administration was moving too slow in deployment (According to Pew Research). The majority of Americans believed that fighting terrorism was imperative for the nation's survival. However, as the war dragged on for over a decade, the majority of Americans became more and more disillusioned with the war, since many felt that the effort would be better spent on our own country.

            <h3>Systematic Improvements</h3>
          </div>
          <p class="service-text">
            The September 11 attacks displayed the imperfections in our architecture and security systems, most of which have been improved over the years. According to the US Army Corps of Engineers, buildings have been reevaluated to include more effective evacuation routes and fire suppression systems. Secerity systems were altered so that there was a more careful balance between public access and security. Airport security experienced a surge in tightened surveillance and maintainance. First response forces were improved in order to better evacuate and rescue the vulnerable in a time of crisis, maximizing how many lives can be saved.

            <h3>Surge in Islamophobia</h3>
          </div>
          <p class="service-text">
            Even though President Bush declared that Islam was a religion of peace, suspicians towards people that practice Islam grew over the years. According to a survey from Pew Research, 50% of people surveyed in the year 2021 share the belief that Islam is more likely to encourage violence than other religions. This only served to undermine the growing Muslim population in the US, who experienced increasing amounts of discrimination. As the final report from the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States discusses in section 12.1, the specific threat is posed by Islamist terrorism, particularly by groups like al Qaeda and their dangerous ideology rooted in a tradition of extreme intolerance within Islam. Islam itself is not the enemy, but rather the perversion of it.
